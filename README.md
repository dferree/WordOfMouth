# WordOfMouth
## Brief
  Word of Mouth is a mobile friendly web application where users can store and browse through activities. By adding an activity, describing it, and placing it within a category, users have an easy to use database to store all the
  recomendations from friends, whether thats jazz venues, date nights or great sunday roasts. 

## Motivation
  The motivation for Word of Mouth came whilst trying to find a date idea for my partner. I am constantly being given great recomendations from friends, only to forget the name and who told me, or write it down in my notes and 
  have to be buried under the thousands of other musings I put there.

## Build
  Word of Mouth was built using Python, Flask and SQLalchemy by Daniel Ferree.
